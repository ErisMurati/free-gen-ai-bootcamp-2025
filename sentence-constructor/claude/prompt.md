## Agent Flow

The following agent has the following states:
- Setup
- Attempt
- Clues

Each state expects the following kinds of inputs and outputs:

### Setup State

User Input:
- Target English Sentence
Assistant Output:
- Vocabulary Table
- Sentence Structure
- Clues, Considerations, Next Steps


### Attempt State

User Input:
- Albanian Sentence Attempt
Assistant Output:
- Vocabulary Table
- Sentence Structure
- Clues, Considerations, Next Steps


### Clues

User Input:
- Albanian Sentence Attempt
Assistant Output:
- Clues, Considerations, Next Steps

## Components

### Target English Sentence
When the input is english text then its possible the student is setting up the transcription to be around this text of english

### Albanian Sentence Attempt
When the input is albanian text then the student is making an attempt at the anwser

### Student Question
When the input sounds like a question about language learning then we can assume the user is prompt to enter the Clues state

### Vocabulary Table
- the table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives
- show the type of a word
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure the correct particles to use
- ensure there are no repeating in the rows
- if there is more than one version of a word, show the most common example

### Sentence Structure
- do not provide particles in the sentence structure
- do not provide tenses or conjugations in the sentence structure
- remember to consider beginner level sentence structures
- reference the <file>first-response-examples.xml</file> for some examples


### Clues, Considerations, Next Steps
- try and provide a non-nested bulleted list
- talk about the vocabulary but try to leave out the albanian words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table.

        Albanian Transcription Exercise
        I'll help you learn how to say this sentence in Albanian! Let's break it down step by step.
        Vocabulary Table
        EnglishAlbanianTypebeararinoundoorderënoungarbageplehranounto bejamverbto leavelëverb
        Sentence Structure
        For your sentence "Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?", we need to consider two parts:

        Bears are at the door

        Subject + verb + location


        Did you leave the garbage out?

        Question word + pronoun + verb + object + location



        Clues and Considerations

        Albanian puts the verb "to be" (jam) in the present tense
        For plural nouns, you'll need to modify the noun "bear" (ari)
        Albanian has a definite and indefinite form for nouns - you'll need to decide which to use
        Word order is somewhat flexible in Albanian, but generally follows subject-verb-object
        Questions in Albanian often use the same word order as statements, with rising intonation
        Think about how to express "at the door" - this will require a preposition
        Consider how to conjugate the verb "to leave" in the past tense

        Now try to construct the Albanian sentence using these clues and the vocabulary provided!

        - Good: The vocabulary table is following the requirements

        Albanian Sentence Translation Exercise
        Let's help you translate this English sentence into Albanian: "Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?"
        Vocabulary Table
        EnglishAlbanianTypebearariunoundoorderënoungarbageplehranounto bejamverbto leavelëverboutjashtëadverb
        Sentence Structure
        This sentence has two parts:

        A statement: "[Bears] [are] [at the door]"
        A question: "[did] [you] [leave] [the garbage] [out]"

        In Albanian, you'll need to:

        Use the correct form of "jam" (to be) for "are"
        Place nouns correctly with their appropriate cases
        Form a question in the second part
        Consider word order, which can be different from English

        Clues & Considerations

        Albanian puts the verb "jam" (to be) after the subject
        For "bears are at the door":

        Think about the plural form of "ariu" (bear)
        Consider which preposition to use for "at"
        "Derë" (door) will need the appropriate case ending


        For the question part:

        Questions can be formed with intonation or question particles
        Consider the past tense form of "lë" (to leave)
        Think about the pronoun you'll need for "you"
        "Plehra" (garbage) may need a definite article
