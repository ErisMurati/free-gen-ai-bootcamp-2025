Here are examples of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score in order to understand why the example is scored higher or lower.

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>8</score>
    <score_reasons>

        Mirëdita! (Good day!) I'm ready to help you translate your English sentence into Albanian. Let's break it down step-by-step.

        First, let's look at the vocabulary we'll need. Here's a table of the words you'll be working with:

        English	Albanian	Part of Speech
        Bear	Ari	Noun
        Door	Derë	Noun
        To be	Jam	Verb
        To leave	Lë	Verb
        Garbage	Mbeturina	Noun
        Out	Jashtë	Adverb

        Now, let's think about the structure of the sentence. It's actually two sentences combined into one question.

        "Bears are at the door."
        "Did you leave the garbage out?"
        In Albanian, the word order can be a little flexible, but for these sentences, we can use a structure similar to this:

        Sentence 1: Subject + Verb + Preposition + Location
        Sentence 2: Question particle + Subject + Verb + Object + Adverb
        Let's begin with the first part, "Bears are at the door."

        How would you express "bears" in the plural form?
        How would you conjugate "to be" to match the plural "bears"?
        How would you express "at the" using "derë" (door)?
    </assistant:output>
</example>

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
        - Bad: The vocabulary table is missing the part of speech for the words of the sentence
        - Bad: The vocabulary table is missing the translation of certain words of the student input
        - Bad: The translations of the words in the vocabulary table are not into their imperative form
        - Bad: Some of the translations of the words in the vocabulary table are wrong
        - Bad: The clues provided on the section are not very clear, more hints to be provided.
        - Good: Possible Sentence Structure is provided
    </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>
        Let's work through this sentence step by step. Here are some clues and vocabulary to help you transcribe the sentence into Albanian.

        Vocabulary
        English	Albanian
        Bear	Ari
        Door	Derë
        Leave	Lënë
        Garbage	Mbeturina
        Out	Jashtë
        Did you	A je
        Possible Sentence Structure
        Subject (Bears) + Verb (are) + Preposition (at) + Object (the door)
        Question Phrase (Did you) + Verb (leave) + Object (the garbage) + Preposition (out)
        Clues
        The sentence consists of two parts: a statement and a question.
        The verb "are" in Albanian might not be explicitly stated, as it can be implied by the context.
        The verb "leave" needs to be conjugated in the past tense.
        Pay attention to the word order and the use of prepositions.
        The question part starts with a question word and follows with the subject and verb.
        Use these clues and the vocabulary to construct the sentence in Albanian. If you have any specific questions or need further hints, feel free to ask!
