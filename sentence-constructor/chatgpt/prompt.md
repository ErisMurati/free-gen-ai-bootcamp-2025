        Alright! Let's work through this step by step.  

        ### **Step 1: Vocabulary**  
        Here are some key words youâ€™ll need to form the sentence:  

        | English        | Albanian      | Part of Speech |
        |---------------|--------------|----------------|
        | bear          | ari          | noun          |
        | door          | derÃ«         | noun          |
        | garbage       | mbeturina    | noun          |
        | to leave      | lÃ«           | verb          |
        | out           | jashtÃ«       | adverb        |

        Now, letâ€™s break it down.  

        ### **Step 2: Sentence Structure Guide**  
        1. **"Bears are at the door"** â†’ In Albanian, the subject ("bears") usually comes first. The verb "to be" (janÃ«) is needed here.  
        - Possible structure: **[Subject] + [to be] + [Location]**  

        2. **"Did you leave the garbage out?"** â†’ This is a past-tense question. Albanian often uses "A" at the beginning for yes/no questions.  
        - Possible structure: **[Question Particle] + [Verb (past)] + [Object] + [Adverb]?**  

        ### **Step 3: Work Through It**  
        Let's start with the first part:  
        **How would you say "Bears are at the door" in Albanian?** Try using the vocabulary and structure above.

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
        - Bad: The vocabulary table is missing the part of speech for the words of the sentence
        - Good: In the table, for each word, the part of speech is mentioned
        - Bad: No sentence structure provided
        - Bad: The explanations are too messy

        Alright! Let's work through this sentence step by step.  

        ### **Step 1: Vocabulary**  
        Here are the key words you need to translate. You must figure out the proper conjugations and particles!  

        | English        | Albanian       | Type      |
        |---------------|--------------|-----------|
        | bear         | ari           | noun      |
        | door         | derÃ«          | noun      |
        | to leave     | lÃ«            | verb      |
        | garbage      | mbeturina     | noun      |
        | out          | jashtÃ«        | adverb    |

        ### **Step 2: Sentence Structure**  
        - **First clause:** *(Bears are at the door)*  
        - "Bears" is plural, so "ari" needs to be pluralized.  
        - "Are" comes from the verb "to be" (*jam*), which must be conjugated.  
        - "At the door" requires figuring out the correct preposition.  

        - **Second clause:** *(Did you leave the garbage out?)*  
        - This is a question in the past tense.  
        - "Did you leave" uses the verb "lÃ«," which must be conjugated in the correct tense.  
        - "The garbage out" should follow natural Albanian word order.  

        ### **Step 3: Work Through It!**  
        Now, try forming the sentence using the clues! Let me know what you come up with, and Iâ€™ll guide you further. ðŸ˜Š
