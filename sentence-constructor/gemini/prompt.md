        Mirëdita! (Good day!) I'm ready to help you translate your English sentence into Albanian. Let's break it down step-by-step.

        First, let's look at the vocabulary we'll need. Here's a table of the words you'll be working with:

        English	Albanian	Part of Speech
        Bear	Ari	Noun
        Door	Derë	Noun
        To be	Jam	Verb
        To leave	Lë	Verb
        Garbage	Mbeturina	Noun
        Out	Jashtë	Adverb

        Now, let's think about the structure of the sentence. It's actually two sentences combined into one question.

        "Bears are at the door."
        "Did you leave the garbage out?"
        In Albanian, the word order can be a little flexible, but for these sentences, we can use a structure similar to this:

        Sentence 1: Subject + Verb + Preposition + Location
        Sentence 2: Question particle + Subject + Verb + Object + Adverb
        Let's begin with the first part, "Bears are at the door."

        How would you express "bears" in the plural form?
        How would you conjugate "to be" to match the plural "bears"?
        How would you express "at the" using "derë" (door)?
    </assistant:output>
</example>

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
        - Bad: The vocabulary table is missing the part of speech for the words of the sentence
        - Bad: No greetings provided
        - Bad: No sentence structure provided
    </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>
        Alright, let's break down this English sentence into Albanian. We'll take it step by step.

        First, let's look at the vocabulary you'll need.

        English	Albanian (Dictionary Form)
        Bear	Ari
        Door	Derë
        Be (are)	Jam (to be)
        Leave	Lë (to leave)
        Garbage	Mbeturina
        Out	Jashtë

        Now, let's look at the sentence structure. We have two parts:

        "Bears are at the door"
        "Did you leave the garbage out?"
        Let's start with the first part: "Bears are at the door."

        Think about how you'd say "bears." Is it singular or plural?
        How would you express "are at" using the verb "jam" and the noun "derë"? Remember, you may need to add a preposition.
        Remember that Albanian often places the definite article after the noun. For example, "the car" is "makina a".
        How would you begin to translate "Bears are at the door?" Give it a try!
