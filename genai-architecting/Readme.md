## Functional Requirements
Since the school has an existing learning portal and learning record store they want to adapt the new solutions as much as possible to the existing platform which is hosted on a on-premises architecture. The new solutions should be build on an internally owned infrastructure. The budget to set up the infrastructure is around 15-20K; these costs are calculated based on the current usage of the platform - around 300 students.
### Potential risks around infrastructure and its cost
The number of users/students may significantly increase in the future and with an on-premises infrastructure the options for scaling it will be way more expensive compared to a cloud based infrastructure. To simplify things we will suppose that the number of students on the platform will stay constant during time.
### Assumptions
We will be choosing an Open-Source LLM with X parameters as our building block, assuming that this model will be run on our infrastructure without problems.
